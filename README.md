# Housing-Price-Prediction
This is a full machine learning project to predict house prices. The project consists of the following steps: <br>
1. Loading the Data Set: Cells 1 to 4. <br>
2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Cells 5 to 25.<br>
3. Feature Engineering: Cells 26 to 28. <br>
4. Linear Regression Model: Cells 29 to 37.<br>
5. Random Forest Model: Cells 38 to 43. <br>

Using python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn and have utilized Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
